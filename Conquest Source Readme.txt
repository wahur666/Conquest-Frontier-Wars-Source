This is the source code for Conquest: Frontier wars.  It has been partially
modified to support the Conquest 2 demo.  All of the game's resource have
also been included.  In short, this should be everything you need to make
mods for Conquest.

This source code was originally written for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0; the
project has been updated to work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.  No other
changes to the source have been made.  Because Conquest uses 16-bit components,
you must build it on a 32-bit operating system that supports them.  Windows XP
will provide the best results.  Because the game uses the old DirectDraw
system, you'll need an older version of the DirectX SDK to compile it with;
the August 2007 SDK works best and is still available on the Internet.

The base solution for Conquest resides in Code/App/CQ2.sln.

Good luck and have fun!  We can't wait to see what you make.
